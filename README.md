# Car_Price_Purchase

You are working as a car salesman and you would like to develop a model to predict the total dollar amount that customers are willing to pay given the following attributes:

               1.Customer Name
               2.Customer e-mail
               3.Country
               4.Gender
               5.Age
               6.Annual Salary
               7.Credit Card Debt
               8.Net Worth



The model should predict:

          1.Car Purchase Amount


Since it is an regression Problem statement we are using ANN for developing Genralised Model.
